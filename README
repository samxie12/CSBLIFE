Since grade school, I always dreamt of being a teacher in the future. So I thought of pursuing Educational Psychology when I enter college. But along the way, technology got popular with the World Wide Web and all. So I got myself into the world of technology and gadgets. On my last year in high school, I felt that my computer skills suddenly emerged. So, change of plans. I told myself maybe I could still pursue teaching in the future. Now that I'm in college, it's very different. New environment of course, not to mention new set of friends. For the past 3 years, I've been used of seeing the same people everyday, but now it's different because I encounter different kinds of people. Before I can go to school by walking but now I have to wake up as early as 5 a.m. so I can avoid the morning traffic. Then the usual breakfast at Mcdonalds then enter class at around 7:30a.m.

It funny because with my new friends, I feel that we've known each other for more than a year or so to think that we've been together for almost 2 weeks only. The people are very warm and also the professors that we've met. De La Salle has been my dream school since I was a kid and now that I'm here, there's no turning back. Even though I feel that I'm not that good in Math, I'd still do my best because I don't wanna fail anyone, most of all myself. I also would not fail any subject because of the scholarship grant that I've got. I know that many things are about to change, I just have to prepare myself, and my feet on the ground.
